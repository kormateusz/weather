## Configuring `secret.properties`

After cloning the repository, you need to create a `secret.properties` file in the project's root directory and add the following line:

`API_KEY="YOUR_KEY"`

Replace `YOUR_KEY` with your own API key, which can be obtained by registering at [AccuWeather Developer](https://developer.accuweather.com/).
